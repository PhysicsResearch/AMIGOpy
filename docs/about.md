# About AMIGOpy

**AMIGOpy** is an open-source medical physics platform designed for research and education in **radiotherapy** and **brachytherapy**. It is the successor to the original **AMIGO** software developed between **2011 and 2015** as part of a **Double-PhD project**. Initially, AMIGO was created primarily as a research tool for **brachytherapy**, but over the years, the software evolved to include resources for **external beam radiotherapy**, including **photons** and **protons**.

Despite this growth, the use of the original AMIGO software remained limited to specific **research groups** and **collaborations** — mainly due to the **lack of proper documentation** and several design constraints.

## Limitations of the Original AMIGO (MATLAB Version)

The initial AMIGO implementation, developed in **MATLAB**, provided valuable functionality but suffered from several important limitations:

* **Lack of documentation** → made onboarding new users and contributors difficult.
* **Non-modular architecture** → upgrades were hard to manage, and many available tools were hidden from the user.
* **MATLAB dependency** → although MATLAB offers powerful scientific tools and a user-friendly language, it is **not free**, limiting access to many potential users.
* **Monte Carlo engine licensing** → the software relied heavily on **MCNP**, which also requires a **paid license** for each user, further restricting accessibility.

## Introducing AMIGOpy

**AMIGOpy** was created to address these limitations and to significantly expand AMIGO's impact in **research** and **education**.

Key advantages of AMIGOpy:

* **Open-source** → freely available for research, education, and development.
* **Python-based** → built using **Python**, an accessible and free programming language widely adopted in the scientific community.
* **Extensive documentation** → provides comprehensive guides for both **users** and **developers**.
* **Modular architecture** → designed from the ground up for maintainability, making it easier to integrate new features and workflows.
* **Flexible Monte Carlo integration** → can be coupled to numerous MC engines, not limited to MCNP, making the platform far more versatile.

With AMIGOpy, our goal is to **increase accessibility**, **foster collaboration**, and **accelerate innovation** in medical physics research.
