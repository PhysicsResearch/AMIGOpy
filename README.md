# AMIGOpy

Welcome to AMIGOpy (A Medical Image-based Graphical platfOrm - Python)! This is an evolution of the previously developed MATLAB-based software AMIGOBrachy. While AMIGOBrachy was a user interface tailored specifically for absorbed dose calculations in brachytherapy coupled with MCNP6 MC code, AMIGOpy extends this functionality and brings a plethora of new features, with a Python backbone and VTK for image rendering.

## Features

- **Modular Support for RadioTherapy Modules**: AMIGOpy offers resources for:
  - Treatment planning visualisation
  - Medical image rendering, contouring and segmentation
  - Check here for a more complete list: https://www.amigo-medphys.com/features
    
- **Enhanced Image Support**: Handle multiple image formats including (1st version focusing on DICOM):
  - Nifti
  - TIFF
  - DICOM
    
- **Radiochromic Film Dosimetry** and **Dual-Energy CT**.
- **Advanced Image Registration**: Seamlessly register and process your medical images.
- **Auto Folder Searching**: Automatically searches folders and subfolders, efficiently grouping and loading data.
- **3D Printing Support**: For customized brachytherapy applicators.

  
## Development Philosophy

The development of AMIGOpy emphasises:

- **Strong Documentation**: Every module, function, and feature is thoroughly documented
- **Extensive user guide**: Videos, tutorials, etc.
