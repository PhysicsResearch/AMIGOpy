# AMIGOpy

Welcome to AMIGOpy (A Medical Image-based Graphical platfOrm - Python)! This is an evolution of the previously developed MATLAB-based software AMIGOBrachy. While AMIGOBrachy was a user interface tailored specifically for absorbed dose calculations in brachytherapy coupled with MCNP6 MC code, AMIGOpy extends this functionality and brings a plethora of new features, with a Python backbone and VTK for image rendering.

## Features

- **Modular Support for Therapy Modules**: Beyond brachytherapy, AMIGOpy offers resources for:
  - External beam photon therapy
  - Proton therapy
- **Enhanced Image Support**: Handle multiple image formats including:
  - Nifti
  - TIFF
  - DICOM
- **Radiochromic Film Dosimetry** and **Dual-Energy CT**.
- **Advanced Image Registration**: Seamlessly register and process your medical images.
- **Auto Folder Searching**: Automatically searches folders and subfolders, efficiently grouping and loading data.
- **3D Printing Support**: For customized brachytherapy applicators.

## Upcoming Features

- **AI-driven Image Processing**:
  - Conversion of MRI into synthetic CT (master project starting soon).
  - Autocontouring and more!
  
## Development Philosophy

The development of AMIGOpy emphasizes:

- **Strong Documentation**: Every module, function, and feature is thoroughly documented for easy understanding and seamless integration.
- **Good Programming Practices**: Clean, efficient, and maintainable code is our mantra.
